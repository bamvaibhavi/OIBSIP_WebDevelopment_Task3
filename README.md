## 📝 Objective
The main objective of this project was to build a functional **To-Do List Application** called "TaskMaster." The goal was to create an interactive tool that helps users organize their daily tasks by allowing them to add, edit, delete, and mark items as complete, demonstrating proficiency in **JavaScript DOM manipulation**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For the structural layout of the input fields and task lists.
* **CSS3:** For styling the interface, creating a clean/modern look, and adding visual cues for completed tasks (e.g., strikethrough effects).
* **JavaScript (ES6):** The core logic engine used for:
    * Event Listeners (Add button, Delete button).
    * DOM Manipulation (Creating and removing list elements dynamically).
    * Logic for marking tasks as "Completed".
* **GitHub:** For version control and hosting.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1.  **UI Design:** Designed a user-friendly interface with an input box and an "Add" button.
2.  **DOM Manipulation:** Wrote JavaScript functions to capture user input and dynamically generate new list items (`<li>`) in the HTML.
3.  **Task Management Logic:**
    * Implemented the **"Add Task"** feature to append new items to the list.
    * Implemented the **"Delete"** feature to remove specific items.
    * Implemented the **"Mark as Done"** feature to toggle a class that strikes through the text.
4.  **Validation:** Added checks to prevent users from adding empty tasks.
5.  **Testing & Hosting:** Tested the app for smooth interaction and deployed it on GitHub Pages.

## 🌟 Outcome
The final outcome is a responsive "TaskMaster" app that allows users to effectively manage their tasks in real-time. It demonstrates a solid understanding of how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements.
